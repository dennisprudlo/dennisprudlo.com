			<h1>Hi, I am Dennis Prudlo</h1>
			<p>I am a highly motivated full stack web & iOS developer based in the heart of Europe â€“ Berlin. I started to learn programming on my own at age 13. Curious about new technologies and new possibilities in development I improved my skills in various languages since then.<p>
			<p>While developing websites I found out that I am very concerned about the overall design and usability. Turns out, I am a UI/UX enthusiast. User experience is the name of the game.</p>
